# 🤖 Dialogflow CX to Microsoft Teams Bot Integration

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect a **Google Dialogflow CX agent** to **Azure Bot Services**, and then integrate that bot into **Microsoft Teams** as a personal assistant that can relay messages into a Teams channel.

This is a rare cross-cloud setup between Google Cloud and Azure, and due to the lack of official documentation, I had to reverse-engineer much of the process through trial, error, and deep debugging.

## 🛠️ Problem

There was no reliable end-to-end documentation on how to:

- Route Dialogflow CX responses through Azure Bot Services.
- Package that bot for use inside Microsoft Teams.
- Relay conversations into Teams channels with the correct permissions and scopes.

Even Microsoft’s advanced support didn’t have a clear path forward.

## ✅ Solution Overview

To solve this, I:

- Connected Dialogflow CX to a GCP-hosted webhook.
- Registered an Azure Bot to relay those messages.
- Built a Teams-compatible bot app using the Teams Developer Portal.
- Published it to Teams for personal chat use and team channel integration.

## 🧩 Integration Steps

### 1. Create Your Dialogflow CX Agent

- Configure intents, flows, and fulfillment in Google Cloud.
- Enable webhook responses and test within Dialogflow.

### 2. Expose the Agent via Webhook

- Deploy a Cloud Function or Cloud Run instance that acts as a proxy.
- Accept `POST` requests from Azure and route them to Dialogflow CX.
- Return CX responses formatted for Microsoft Bot Framework.

### 3. Register Azure Bot Service

- Create an Azure Bot resource.
- Set the messaging endpoint to your GCP webhook.
- Save your Microsoft App ID and secret for later use.

### 4. Configure Teams Bot in Developer Portal

This was the most complex part. Here's what worked for me:

#### 🔹 Register a New Teams App

- Go to [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) and create a new app.
- Use the same Microsoft App ID from your Azure Bot registration.

#### 🔹 Configure the Bot Identity

- Add app icons and basic branding.
- Under **App Features**, define this app as a **Bot**.
- Use the Azure App ID for the bot.
- Scope the bot to **Personal** so it can respond 1:1.

#### 🔹 Add Trusted Domains

- Add domains required for communication:
  - `*.botframework.com`
  - Your production hosting domain (if needed)

#### 🔹 Validate & Publish

- Use the built-in validator to check for issues.
- Publish the app internally to your org.
- Make sure a Teams admin approves the app and sets proper access.

## 🚀 Post-Deployment Notes

- 🔄 Permissions can take several minutes to propagate—**be patient**.
- ✅ An admin must approve app permissions or it won’t function.
- 🧪 Use the **“Test in Web Chat”** feature under your Azure Bot to validate CX responses before installing in Teams.
- 🔐 Ensure the app isn’t blocked by org policy.
- 🔁 Set Teams scopes correctly in the Admin Center to allow channel relays.

---

## 🎉 Outcome

- Users can message the bot in Teams, which relays input to Dialogflow CX.
- CX generates a response which is returned through Azure Bot to Teams.
- All queries and responses are captured in a Teams channel for visibility.

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- Multi-cloud integration is very real—and very painful without docs.
- Testing in isolated layers (GCP → Azure → Teams) helped massively.
- Teams bots require very precise scope
